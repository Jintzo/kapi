# Routes

Routes extend [Express.Router](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#router) by adding specific routes to it, which call their respective [model](/model/README)'s functions.

All routes are written in compliance with the [JSON API Standard](http://jsonapi.org), which means that all API errors can be handled in a uniform way.
